## Development Approach

For each exercise:

1. Start with clear requirements and expected functionality
2. Design the type system before implementing logic
3. Use the strictest TypeScript compiler settings
4. Refactor for type safety after initial implementation
5. Add tests to verify both types and functionality

Mark each exercise as completed once you've:
- Implemented all core functionality
- Used appropriate TypeScript features
- Ensured it passes strict type checking
- Added appropriate tests (when applicable)
- Reviewed for potential type improvements
